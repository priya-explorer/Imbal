## GOAL:
- An approach to find insights about 'Employee Attrition' from the data given for the HR department in an organization using python. Also, to find the important factors associated with the attrition so that HR can take measures to control the attrition of employees.

## Steps for Python implementation
1) EDA
   i) Load the data. Check the datatypes. 
  ii) Quality Analysis - Find Missing Value, Duplicates
 iii) Correlation check
  iv) Visualization - Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis on Numerical and Categorical features
   v) Attrition Rate - Attrition Rate vs Non-Attrition Rate in various features
   vi) -Key Insights
