# Employee Attrition Analysis - An Imbalanced Classification Problem

## GOAL: To prepare a model for the HR department to predict the Attrition. And, give insights from the data about the important factors associated with the attrition so that HR can take measures to control the attrition of employees.

### Attrition is a metric that represents the percentage of employees who leave an organisation(either voluntarily or involuntarily) for reasons including resignation, termination, death or retirement.

Hiring cost to replace employees
Impact those employees working with them that can result in adding more work to them. This can increase stress and impact organization’s performance


## Steps for Python implementation
### 1) EDA
   
     i) Load the data. Check the datatypes. 
  
    ii) Quality Analysis - Find Missing Value, Duplicates
 
    iii) Correlation check
  
    iv) Visualization - Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis on Numerical and Categorical features
   
     v) Attrition Rate - Attrition Rate vs Non-Attrition Rate in various features
   
    ### vi) Key Insights
